# STAg: Sublime Text [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) Plugin

### Search code really really fast.

### Development status: ???

# Installation instructions

* If you have [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), go to Package Control â†’ Install Package and search for STAg. Select the STAg package and install it.

* If you don't have Package Control (or you prefer to install the plugin manually), clone this repository or download and extract [this tarball](https://github.com/ggreer/stag/archive/master.zip).
* Rename the directory to "STAg".
* In Sublime Text, go to Preferences -> Browse Packages.
* Drag, copy, or move the STAg directory into your Packages directory.

If you'd rather create a symlink instead of copy/moving, run something like:

    ln -s ~/code/stag ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/STAg
